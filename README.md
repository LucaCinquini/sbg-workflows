# Readme

Repository to store the SBG workflows implemented within unity. SBG Workflows consists of:
1. L1B pre-process
2. L1B ISOFIT
3. L2 Spectral Resample
4. L2 Reflectance Correction Resample
5. L2B Fractional Cover
6. L2 Train Estimation (Terestrial Ecology)

The above workflows consist of search (when required), stage-in, process, stage-out, and catalog steps. The inputs and outputs required can be seen in the **workflow input** sections below.

Additionally, there is an end-to-end wokflow encompassing workflows 1-5 above. the Train Estimation workflow is executed when the outputs of
